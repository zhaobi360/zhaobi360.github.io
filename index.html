<h2>a song i recently listen a lot</h2>
<p> <strong> HELLO BY <a href="http://adele.com"> ADELE</a> </strong> <br>

Hello, it's me <br> 
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet <br> 
To go over everything <br> 
They say that time's supposed to heal ya <br> 
But I ain't done much healing <br> 
Hello, can you hear me <br> 
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be <br> 
When we were younger and free <br> 
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet <br> 
There's such a difference between us <br> 
And a million miles <br> 
Hello from the other side <br> 
I must have called a thousand times <br> 
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done <br> 
But when I call you never seem to be home <br> 
Hello from the outside <br> 
At least I can say that I've tried <br> 
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart <br> 
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore <br> 
Hello, how are you? </p>
